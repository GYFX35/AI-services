# AI Agent: Software Engineer, Debugger, Marketer, System Analyzer, and Designer

This project is a web-based AI agent that can perform several roles to assist with software development and business tasks.

## Features

- **Software Engineer:** Generates multi-section HTML and CSS for a static website based on a structured text prompt.
- **Debugger:** Lints HTML and CSS code to find basic errors. Can analyze pasted code or fetch a file directly from a GitHub URL.
- **Marketer:** Creates promotional social media posts from a business description.
- **System Analyzer:** Scans a website URL for broken links and suggests search queries to find solutions.
- **Designer:** Finds royalty-free images and videos, and generates simple CSS animation scripts.

## How to Use

### Software Engineer
The Software Engineer agent uses a simple, indented syntax to define the components of a website. Provide a description in the "Software Engineer" text box, and the agent will return the HTML and CSS code in the response box below.

**Example Prompt:**
```
title: My Photography Portfolio
header: Jane Doe | Photographer
section: About Me
  text: I am a professional photographer specializing in landscapes.
section: Gallery
  images: 4
footer: Copyright Â© 2024 Jane Doe
```

### Debugger
The Debugger agent can analyze code in two ways:
1.  **Paste Code:** Paste your HTML or CSS code directly into the large text area.
2.  **Use a GitHub URL:** Paste the URL of a public file on GitHub into the smaller URL input field.

The agent will automatically fetch the code from the URL and analyze it.

### System Analyzer
Enter a full website URL (e.g., `https://example.com`) to scan the page for broken links.

### Designer
The Designer agent can help you with visual assets and animations.
- **To find images:** Use prompts like `a photo of a sunset` or `an image of a computer`. The agent will provide a search link for royalty-free images on Unsplash.
- **To find videos:** Use prompts like `a video of the ocean`. The agent will provide a search link for royalty-free videos on Pexels.
- **To generate animations:** Use prompts like `a script for a fade in animation`. The agent will provide a CSS code snippet for the animation.
