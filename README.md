### How It Works

Our platform connects to multiple AI services to provide a suite of tools for developers and entrepreneurs. The core of the application is a Flask-based backend that serves a user-friendly frontend. The AI functionalities are powered by Google's Vertex AI, enabling features like code generation, debugging, and content creation. The platform is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the integration of new AI-powered tools in the future.

## Features

- **Software Engineer:** Generates multi-section HTML and CSS for a static website based on a structured text prompt.
- **Debugger:** Lints HTML and CSS code to find basic errors. Can analyze pasted code or fetch a file directly from a GitHub URL.
- **Marketer:** Creates promotional social media posts from a business description.
- **System Analyzer:** Scans a website URL for broken links and suggests search queries to find solutions.

## How to Use

### Software Engineer
The Software Engineer agent uses a simple, indented syntax to define the components of a website. Provide a description in the "Software-Engineer" text box, and the agent will return the HTML and CSS code in the response box below.

**Example Prompt:**
```
title: My Photography Portfolio
header: Jane Doe | Photographer
section: About Me
  text: I am a professional photographer specializing in landscapes.
section: Gallery
  images: 4
footer: Copyright © 2024 Jane Doe
```

### Debugger
The Debugger agent can analyze code in two ways:
1.  **Paste Code:** Paste your HTML or CSS code directly into the large text area.
2.  **Use a GitHub URL:** Paste the URL of a public file on GitHub into the smaller URL input field.

The agent will automatically fetch the code from the URL and analyze it.

### System Analyzer
Enter a full website URL (e.g., `https://example.com`) to scan the page for broken links.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pip` for installing Python packages

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GYFX35/AI-services.git
   cd AI-services
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file:**
   - Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   flask init-db
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. **Open your web browser:**
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.

## Developer Deployment and Integration

This project is configured for easy use across multiple platforms.
